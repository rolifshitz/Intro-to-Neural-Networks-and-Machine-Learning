# Intro-to-Neural-Networks-and-Machine-Learning

## What is this repo?
In 2021, I took a course on Neural Networks and Machine Learning ([PHYSICS 3G03, McMaster University](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=41&coid=222058)). This repo contains my assignments that I coded throughout this course. The first half of the course emphasized implementing ML algorithms from the ground up using Numpy, and the second half focused on implementing ML algorithms using state of the art packages such as Keras TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Areas of Focus 
I had a great time during this course and learned the following topics:
### Numpy Implementation:
1. Feature vectors, Spam detection
2. Zeroth order optimization
3. Random Search, Coordinate Search and Descent
4. Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic GD
5. Momentum Accelerated GD, Normalized GD
6. Mini-Batch, SGD, Auto Differentiation
7. Back Propagataion, Hessians
8. Newton's Method, Linear Regression
9. Logistic Regression, Cross Enropy Loss
10. Decision Boundaries, Softmax and Perceptron Costs
11. Softmax and Regularization
12. Support Vector Machines and Quality Metrics
13. Multiclass Classification, One-Versus-All, Categorical Classifications
14. Linear Autoencoder
15. Autoencoders, Clustering
16. K-Means Clustering
### Tensorflow (Keras), and PyTorch
17. Linear Regression with Tensorflow
18. Tensorflow with MNIST Digits
19. Backpropagation, Convolution Networks
20. Neurons, Pooling, Dropout
21. Fashion MNIST
22. Network Capacity, ResNet-50
23. Nonlinear Regression and Classification
24. Universal Approximators, Cross-Validation
25. Boosting and Bagging
26. Decision Trees (also the numpy implementation of Decision Trees)
27. Information Entropy
28. Info Gain Ratio, Gini Index
29. Bayes Rule, Bayesian Classification
30. Naive Bayes, Hopfield Model

## Course Textbook
The textbook *Machine Learning Refined* by Jeremy Watt, Reza Borhani, Aggelos Konstantinos Katsaggelos was used throughout the course. You can find the textbook and tutorials on this [open source github repo](https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined) created by its authors. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to delve into Machine Learning!
